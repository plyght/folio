I've come across many design studio websites with a neat custom cursor in place of your default computer one. Might not be the most accessible thing in the world, but it looks cool. Recently, I added one to my [website](https://harshsingh.xyz) as well.

I wrote mines from scratch as all the NPM libraries I found were either outdated, or didn't support server-side rendering.

After adding the cursor to my own website, I'd been wanting to create an NPM package for it for a while, and I got to work this weekend creating [custom-pointer-react](https://github.com/harshhhdev/custom-pointer-react). I couldn't find a better name which wasn't already taken.

This library supports [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), along with server-side rendering ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Remix](https://remix.run))

Want a demo? I setup a quick [demo website](https://harshsingh.xyz/custom-pointer-react/) to for you to tweak and experiment with the library.

## Setup

To download the library, head over to your terminal:

```bash:terminal
yarn add custom-pointer-react
```

Next, import the cursor component into your file and customise it. Don't forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.

```tsx:tsx
import { Cursor } from 'custom-pointer-react'
...
const Cursor = () => {
  return (
    ...
    <Cursor {...passParametersToCustomise} />
    ...
  )
}
...
export default App
```

## Parameters

All parameters are optional, and here's a list of the different parameters which you can customise:

| Parameter  | Description                                         | Default |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| color      | The background color of the cursor                  | #000000 |
| showRing   | Controls whether to show the ring around the cursor | true    |
| ringSize   | Controls the size of the ring around the cursor     | 50px    |
| cursorSize | Controls the size of the cursor                     | 10px    |
| ringBorder | Controls the width of the ring's border             | 2px     |

Need help finding the right parameters? Check out the [demo website](https://harshhhdev.github.io/custom-pointer-react/).

Now, go into your app and import the `MouseContext` provider.

```tsx:pages/_app.tsx
import { MouseContextProvider } from 'custom-pointer-react'
...
ReactDOM.render(
  <MouseContextProvider>
    <App />
  </MouseContextProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
...
```

Your custom cursor should be good to go.

## Conclusion

I hope this helped you out, I'm interested to see what you make with the library. I'd love if you dropped a star over at [harshhhdev/custom-pointer-react](https://github.com/harshhhdev/custom-pointer-react).

Enjoy the rest of your day. Until next time ðŸ‘‹
